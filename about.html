        <h2>What is G1FTB0X?</h2>
        <p>Is a box of gifts. It is a cool looking name I made that I am using to represent my love for old ways and homage to IT fields while seeming cool lol. It is a box that
        I hope everyone opens and gets a gift from, something to inspire or inform, something to help spawn curosity or creativity. IT is the best gift of all, and many other 
        prepackaged puns</p>
        
        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>I am an old nerd from the 90s, born in the 80s. I remember before the interwebz, before cell phones, before computers. Then slowly the tech consumed my mind. I love IT
        All aspects of it from the repair side, to the security side, the Hacker sides, to the network and AI and everywhere in between.  Join me on my journies into the space that
        my  own. My Spacebook as I will call it. I will share my knowledge with others through tutorials or maybe even chatrooms in the future. I want a space for old nerds to share
        their stories and memories, and for others to learn and share their knowledge. This is the start of an interesting chapter and glad for all that are going to be a part of it.
        I will try to do multiple platforms and share tutorials from various projects I am working on all that jazz. I also am a huge science nerd, Ham Radio operator, Conscious studies, physics,  space junkie and musician and kind
        of an all around just general badass to be honest. So buckle up for some nerdy fun. Open the box and get the gift. </p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>I feel from the simple relatable, and even unrelatable stories. To the small tutorials that gets people who are not so familiar with some of these IT concepts like
            how computers work, how AI works, how can you use AI. How can you be safe online etc etc. I want to use this platform to share other content and to just inform and 
            allow for others to also create and share and network and make a spacebook someday where we all can have our own network, maybe on IRC like back in the days. 
            I really want to reach both the everyday person that is clueless, to the every tech that we can teach eachother things with. I know there are many other platforms out there
            But this one is mine, and have a lot of projects coming and games I want to make. AI and I are going to create some pretty amazing things so stay tuned.</p>
