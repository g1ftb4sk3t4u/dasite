        <h2>📦 About G1FTB0X</h2>
        
        <h3>What is G1FTB0X?</h3>
        <p>A box of gifts. A cool name I created to represent my love for old ways and homage to IT fields while staying relevant and edgy. G1FTB0X is a box that I hope everyone opens and receives a gift from—something to inspire or inform, something to spark curiosity or creativity. IT is the best gift of all, with all the prepackaged puns that come with it.</p>

        <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
        <p>I'm an old nerd from the 90s, born in the 80s. I remember life before the internet, before cell phones, before computers took over everything. Then, slowly, tech consumed my mind entirely. I love IT—all aspects of it. From repair and security, to hacking and networking, to AI and everything in between.</p>
        
        <p>Join me on my journeys into my own personal space—my "Spacebook" as I call it. I'll share my knowledge through tutorials, projects, and maybe even chatrooms in the future. I want a space where old nerds can share their stories and memories, and where others can learn and contribute their knowledge. This is the start of an interesting chapter, and I'm grateful for everyone joining the ride.</p>
        
        <p>I'm also a huge science nerd, Ham Radio operator, conscious studies enthusiast, physics and space junkie, musician, and kind of an all-around general badass to be honest. I'll be sharing tutorials from various projects across multiple platforms. So buckle up for some nerdy fun. Open the box and get your gift.</p>

        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>I believe in the power of relatable stories—and even the unrelatable ones. Small tutorials that help people unfamiliar with IT concepts understand how computers work, how AI functions, and how to use both safely online. I want to use this platform to share content that informs, educates, and enables others to create, share, and network.</p>
        
        <p>My vision is a "Spacebook" where we can all maintain our own networks—maybe even like the old IRC days. I want to reach both the everyday person who's clueless about tech and the experienced technologist—so we can teach each other things. Yes, there are many platforms out there, but this one is mine. And I have a lot of projects and games in the pipeline.</p>
        
        <p>AI and I are going to create some pretty amazing things together. Stay tuned.</p>
