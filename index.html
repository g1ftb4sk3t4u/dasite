        <h2>Whoami</h2>
        <p>I am glad you asked. I am a father, a brother, a nerd,comics, a lover of art and music and space and AI and tech and consciousness and ok almost everything. 
        If you are a fan of any of the things above, this maybe the place for you. Soon I will start an Official social media project called spacebook. More details to come. 
        I will also drop AI related projects I am working on along with write ups on Medium and maybe tiktok and youtube in the future. I love being a Father, I love being 
        a musician and love being an IT nerd, which when I say that, I mean it in  every way one can be. With AI, even moreso since the ability to do so much more is here. 
        with learning, to coding to automation To soon just AI we will have on our devices locally, the landscape is forever changing in the world of IT and so I am in for 
        for the ride. Xennials welcome, as is everyone else. </p>
