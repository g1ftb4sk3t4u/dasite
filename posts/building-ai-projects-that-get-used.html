        <p><strong>Everybody builds AI projects. Very few people use them. Here's how to change that.</strong></p>

        <h2>The Problem With Most AI Projects</h2>
        <p>You've probably seen it: someone builds a cool AI chatbot, fine-tunes an LLM, or creates an AI-powered automation tool. They get 50 GitHub stars, write a medium post, and then... nothing. The project sits dormant.</p>
        <p>The issue isn't the technology. It's that most AI projects solve the wrong problem: <strong>they solve a problem the builder found interesting, not a problem people actually need solved</strong>.</p>
        <p>Let me show you how to flip this.</p>

        <h2>1. Start With A Real Problem (Not An AI Idea)</h2>
        <p><strong>Wrong approach:</strong> "I want to build something with LLMs. What can I make?"</p>
        <p><strong>Right approach:</strong> "What problem do I experience every day that wastes my time?"</p>
        <p>Ask yourself:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What tasks do I repeat weekly?</li>
            <li>What takes me 2+ hours to do manually?</li>
            <li>What do I complain about to friends?</li>
            <li>What would my coworkers pay for?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> I noticed I spent 45 minutes every Friday compiling team updates into a weekly report. That's a real problem. An AI tool that scrapes messages, summarizes them, and formats them as a report? That has instant value.</p>
        <p><strong>Your task:</strong> Write down 3 problems you face. Pick one. This is your starting point.</p>

        <h2>2. Solve The Problem With Or Without AI First</h2>
        <p>Here's where people get it wrong: they force AI into the solution.</p>
        <p>"I need to organize my notes better... I know! I'll build a neural network!"</p>
        <p>No. A good spreadsheet might be all you need.</p>
        <p><strong>The principle:</strong> Use the simplest tool that solves the problem. AI is a tool, not a solution on its own.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Manually sorting customer feedback. <strong>Simple solution:</strong> A spreadsheet with filters. <strong>AI upgrade:</strong> LLM categorizes feedback automatically.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Code reviews take too long. <strong>Simple solution:</strong> A checklist. <strong>AI upgrade:</strong> ChatGPT analyzes code for common issues first.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Writing repetitive emails. <strong>Simple solution:</strong> Email templates. <strong>AI upgrade:</strong> Fine-tuned model generates personalized versions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Your task:</strong> For the problem you picked, write out the simplest solution first. Then think: where would AI actually make this better?</p>

        <h2>3. Build For The Specific Use Case, Not The General One</h2>
        <p><strong>Don't build:</strong> "A general-purpose AI assistant"<br/>
        <strong>Build:</strong> "An AI assistant for therapists to track session notes"</p>
        <p><strong>Don't build:</strong> "An AI code reviewer"<br/>
        <strong>Build:</strong> "An AI code reviewer for React components that checks for accessibility issues"</p>
        <p>Specific = useful. General = ignored.</p>
        <p>Why? Because specific problems have specific metrics for success. A therapist knows exactly if your notes tool saves them time. A React developer knows if your reviewer caught bugs they missed.</p>
        <p><strong>Your task:</strong> Who is your end user in one sentence? What's their biggest pain point?</p>

        <h2>4. Make It Easy To Get Started (Seriously)</h2>
        <p>Your AI project is useless if nobody can figure out how to run it.</p>
        <p>Common mistakes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Requires 5 environment variables to set up</li>
            <li>Needs 3 API keys from different services</li>
            <li>Has a 2-page README nobody will read</li>
            <li>Requires Python 3.8 but docs don't mention it</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Make setup take less than 5 minutes.</strong></p>
        <p>Real example of good onboarding:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click one button to deploy</li>
            <li>Enter one API key</li>
            <li>Done</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tools that do this well: Vercel, Replit, Hugging Face Spaces. Your project should match that standard.</p>
        <p><strong>Your task:</strong> Write down the exact steps someone needs to use your project. If it's more than 5 steps, simplify.</p>

        <h2>5. Show It In Action (With Real Results)</h2>
        <p>Don't just describe your AI project. <strong>Show it working on a real problem.</strong></p>
        <p>Instead of: "This chatbot uses fine-tuned GPT to answer customer questions"<br/>
        Say: "This chatbot reduced response time from 2 hours to 30 seconds. Here's the before/after transcript."</p>
        <p><strong>Content types that work:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Side-by-side comparisons (manual vs. AI)</li>
            <li>Time/cost saved (e.g., "saves 10 hours/month")</li>
            <li>Case study with a real person using it</li>
            <li>Demo video showing the full workflow</li>
            <li>Metrics: accuracy %, speed improvement, error reduction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Numbers convince people. Stories convince people to care. Use both.</p>
        <p><strong>Your task:</strong> What metric proves your project works? How will you measure it?</p>

        <h2>6. Build In Public (Even If Your Project Isn't Perfect)</h2>
        <p>Share your progress before it's done. You'll get feedback earlier. You'll build an audience. You'll stay accountable.</p>
        <p><strong>Share at these stages:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> "I'm building X because Y problem"</li>
            <li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> "Here's a rough demo"</li>
            <li><strong>Stage 3:</strong> "It's working but needs polish"</li>
            <li><strong>Stage 4:</strong> "It's live, here's the code"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Post on Twitter, write on Medium, share in relevant Discord servers. Get feedback. Adjust. Repeat.</p>
        <p><strong>Your task:</strong> Where will you announce your project? (Twitter, Product Hunt, Reddit, Discord, LinkedIn?)</p>

        <h2>7. Make Money or Create Impact (Pick One)</h2>
        <p>Your project doesn't have to be free. Your project doesn't have to be a startup.</p>
        <p>Pick your goal:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Goal: Impact</strong> → Make it open-source, free, easy to use</li>
            <li><strong>Goal: Money</strong> → Build a paid product, SaaS, or consulting gig around it</li>
            <li><strong>Goal: Portfolio</strong> → Make it impressive and well-documented for hiring</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Your task:</strong> What's your goal for this project? Be honest with yourself.</p>

        <h2>Case Study: What Works</h2>
        <p><strong>Successful AI Project Pattern:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ Solves one specific problem extremely well</li>
            <li>✅ Takes less than 5 minutes to set up</li>
            <li>✅ Shows clear before/after results</li>
            <li>✅ Has open source code or accessible demo</li>
            <li>✅ Built in public from the start</li>
            <li>✅ Has clear business model (free, paid, or both)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Failed AI Project Pattern:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>❌ Tries to solve everything</li>
            <li>❌ Takes 30 minutes to configure</li>
            <li>❌ No metrics or proof of impact</li>
            <li>❌ Code is private or hard to access</li>
            <li>❌ Announced once when finished</li>
            <li>❌ Unclear if you can use it</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Action Plan</h2>
        <p><strong>This week:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify one problem you face (see section 1)</li>
            <li>Write the simplest solution (see section 2)</li>
            <li>Define your specific user (see section 3)</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Next week:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Build a basic version</li>
            <li>Get it working on your own use case</li>
            <li>Announce it somewhere</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Following week:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Collect feedback</li>
            <li>Improve based on real usage</li>
            <li>Make it public</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Most AI projects fail because they're built backwards. They start with technology instead of problems. They're made for people instead of by people who know the pain.</p>
        <p><strong>Flip it:</strong> Find a real problem. Solve it simply. Use AI where it actually helps. Make it easy to use. Show it works. Build in public. Done.</p>
        <p>That's how you build AI projects people actually use.</p>
